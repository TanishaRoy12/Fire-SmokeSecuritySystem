# Fire-SmokeSecuritySystem
An IoT-based fire and smoke detection system using an Arduino Uno R3 connected to smoke and flame sensors continuously monitors the environment. Upon detecting fire or smoke, it sends a signal to a central node to call or SMS the user, triggers a local alarm, activates an exhaust fan, and sends data to a GSM module (SIM900A).
